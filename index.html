                        <p>Basically, <strong><em>California Assembly Bill 5</em></strong> or
                            <strong><em>AB-5</em></strong> is a state statute that codifies a law which holds that most
                            workers are employees, ought to be classified as such, and the burden of proof for
                            classifying individuals as independent contractors belongs to the hiring entity.

                            <p>AB-5 entitles workers classified as employees to greater labor protections, such as
                                minimum wage laws, sick leave, and unemployment and workers' compensation benefits,
                                which do not apply to independent contractors. </p>

                            <p>The law codifies the <em>ABC test</em>. The test includes a three-prong assessment to
                                determine if a worker was misclassified:
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>That “the individual is free from direction and control,” applicable both“under
                                        his contract for the performance of service and in fact,”</li>
                                    <li>That “the service is performed outside the usual course of business of the
                                        employer,” and </li>
                                    <li>That the “individual is customarily engaged in an independently established
                                        trade, occupation, profession, or business ofthe same nature as that involved in
                                        the service performed.” </li>
                                </ol>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Consider this familiar situation: You get a call from a local restaurant asking if your group
                            is available Saturday night. You, the band leader, get the group together, advise them of
                            the time and the pay for the night.</p>

                        <p>You all play the gig and at the end of the night, you pay them, divide up the tips, and
                            everyone loads out and goes their separate ways. Pretty standard so far, right?</p>

                        <p>Assembly Bill 5, however, says that as the band leader, you are the “hiring entity”. This
                            means the musicians that you hire are now your employees because you:
                            <ul>
                                <li>“Control and direct” how the gig is performed (what songs to play, when to take
                                    breaks)</li>
                                <li>You are in the music business, the same as your musicians.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And if they’re your employees, that means you have to provide them with all of the things
                                that an employer is required to provide.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Worker’s compensation insurance</li>
                                <li>Meal and rest breaks</li>
                                <li>Overtime and other requirements</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The additional cost can put a musician out of business.</p>

                        </p>Dear Ms. Gonzalez,<br><br>
                        Champion Income Tax, Inc represents and prepares tax returns for several professional musicians
                        across the United States. We, the undersigned respectfully request the California Assembly Bill
                        AB-5 be modified to exempt professional musicians. Musicians are hardworking artists who provide
                        a valuable service to our economy and our community, most of them bringing in a modest income.
                        Many musicians are not in a union and therefore have no representation. To categorize them as
                        employees puts a heavy hardship on them. Often musicians work for several clients, both short
                        term and longer commitments throughout California and the United States. They are highly trained
                        professionals and have always worked independently. Most musicians are truly independent
                        contractors based on the following factors:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Own their own businesses as Sole Proprietors or other entity (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC,
                                    Partnership)</li>
                                <li> Possess City Business License</li>
                                <li> Set their own rates according to their knowledge and expertise</li>
                                <li> Sign Contracts for work</li>
                                <li> Provide their own Insurance</li>
                                <li> Work in their Studio or Home office</li>
                                <li> Give Music Lessons</li>
                                <li> Write Songs, Charts or Scores</li>
                                <li> Use their own tools (instruments)</li>
                                <li> May turn down work at their discretion</li>
                            </ul>
