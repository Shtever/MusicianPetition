                        <p>Basically, <strong><em>California Assembly Bill 5</em></strong> or
                            <strong><em>AB-5</em></strong> is a state statute that codifies a law which holds that most
                            workers are employees, ought to be classified as such, and the burden of proof for
                            classifying individuals as independent contractors belongs to the hiring entity.

                            <p>AB-5 entitles workers classified as employees to greater labor protections, such as
                                minimum wage laws, sick leave, and unemployment and workers' compensation benefits,
                                which do not apply to independent contractors. </p>

                            <p>The law codifies the <em>ABC test</em>. The test includes a three-prong assessment to
                                determine if a worker was misclassified:
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>That “the individual is free from direction and control,” applicable both“under
                                        his contract for the performance of service and in fact,”</li>
                                    <li>That “the service is performed outside the usual course of business of the
                                        employer,” and </li>
                                    <li>That the “individual is customarily engaged in an independently established
                                        trade, occupation, profession, or business ofthe same nature as that involved in
                                        the service performed.” </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Consider this familiar situation: You get a call from a local restaurant asking if you can
                                get a
                                group together to provide background music on Saturday night. So you call around to your
                                musician
                                friends to see who is free, get a group together, and tell them what time the gig is and
                                the pay
                                for
                                the night. Then you all play the gig and at the end of the night, you pay them, divide
                                up the
                                tips,
                                and everyone loads out and goes their separate ways. Pretty standard so far, right?</p>

                        <p>
                            Post-AB5, however, not so much. The reason is two-fold. First, under AB5, if a musician is
                            under“the
                            control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the
                            work,”then he
                            is an employee of the hiring entity, not an independent contractor. And second, if
                            themusician
                            performs work that is in the “usual course of the hiring entity’s business,” she is also
                            anemployee,
                            not an independent contractor. So let’s take a look at the gig situation post-AB5. </p>

                        <p>The problem is that, as the band leader, you are the “hiring entity” when you call up your
                            friends
                            and offer to pay them in exchange for playing the gig, which means they are now your
                            employees
                            because you:
                            <ol>
                                <li>“control and direct” how the gig goes (e.g., what songs to play, when to take
                                    breaks,etc.)and </li>
                                <li>you are in the music business, the same as your friends.</li>
                            </ol>
                            And if they’re your employees, that means you have to provide them with all of the
                            manythings thatan
                            employer is required to provide – worker’s compensation, meal and rest breaks, overtime,and
                            thelist
                            goes on. Obviously, no musician wants to do all of that just to get a group togetherfor
                            adinner gig
                            paying everyone $75-100 for a few hours of work.</p>

                        </p>Dear Ms. Gonzalez,<br><br>
                        Champion Income Tax, Inc represents and prepares tax returns for several professional musicians
                        across the United States. We, the undersigned respectfully request the California Assembly Bill
                        AB-5 be modified to exempt professional musicians. Musicians are hardworking artists who provide
                        a valuable service to our economy and our community, most of them bringing in a modest income.
                        Many musicians are not in a union and therefore have no representation. To categorize them as
                        employees puts a heavy hardship on them. Often musicians work for several clients, both short
                        term and longer commitments throughout California and the United States. They are highly trained
                        professionals and have always worked independently. Most musicians are truly independent
                        contractors based on the following factors:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Own their own businesses as Sole Proprietors or other entity (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC,
                                    Partnership)</li>
                                <li> Possess City Business License</li>
                                <li> Set their own rates according to their knowledge and expertise</li>
                                <li> Sign Contracts for work</li>
                                <li> Provide their own Insurance</li>
                                <li> Work in their Studio or Home office</li>
                                <li> Give Music Lessons</li>
                                <li> Write Songs, Charts or Scores</li>
                                <li> Use their own tools (instruments)</li>
                                <li> May turn down work at their discretion</li>
                            </ul>
