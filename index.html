                    <p>Basically, <strong><em>California Assembly Bill 5</em></strong> or
                        <strong><em>AB-5</em></strong> is a state statute that codifies a law which holds that most
                        workers are employees, ought to be classified as such, and the burden of proof for
                        classifying individuals as independent contractors belongs to the hiring entity.

                        <p>AB-5 entitles workers classified as employees to greater labor protections, such as
                            minimum wage laws, sick leave, and unemployment and workers' compensation benefits,
                            which do not apply to independent contractors. </p>

                        <p>The law codifies the <em>ABC test</em>. The test includes a three-prong assessment to
                            determine if a worker was misclassified:
                            <ol type="A">
                                <li>That “the individual is free from direction and control,” applicable both“under
                                    his contract for the performance of service and in fact,”</li>
                                <li>That “the service is performed outside the usual course of business of the
                                    employer,” and </li>
                                <li>That the “individual is customarily engaged in an independently established
                                    trade, occupation, profession, or business ofthe same nature as that involved in
                                    the service performed.” </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p><u>Consider this familiar situation: You get a call from a local restaurant asking if you can
                            get a
                            group together to provide background music on Saturday night. So you call around to your
                            musician
                            friends to see who is free, get a group together, and tell them what time the gig is and
                            the pay
                            for
                            the night. Then you all play the gig and at the end of the night, you pay them, divide
                            up the
                            tips,
                            and everyone loads out and goes their separate ways. Pretty standard so far, right?</p>

                    <p>
                        Post-AB5, however, not so much. The reason is two-fold. First, under AB5, if a musician is
                        under“the
                        control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the
                        work,”then he
                        is an employee of the hiring entity, not an independent contractor. And second, if
                        themusician
                        performs work that is in the “usual course of the hiring entity’s business,” she is also
                        anemployee,
                        not an independent contractor. So let’s take a look at the gig situation post-AB5. </p>

                    <p>The problem is that, as the band leader, you are the “hiring entity” when you call up your
                        friends
                        and offer to pay them in exchange for playing the gig, which means they are now your
                        employees
                        because you:
                        <ol>
                            <li>“control and direct” how the gig goes (e.g., what songs to play, when to take
                                breaks,etc.)and </li>
                            <li>you are in the music business, the same as your friends.</li>
                        </ol>
                        And if they’re your employees, that means you have to provide them with all of the
                        manythings thatan
                        employer is required to provide – worker’s compensation, meal and rest breaks, overtime,and
                        thelist
                        goes on. Obviously, no musician wants to do all of that just to get a group togetherfor
                        adinner gig
                        paying everyone $75-100 for a few hours of work.</p>

                    </p>Dear Ms. Gonzalez,<br><br>
                    Champion Income Tax, Inc represents and prepares tax returns for several professional musicians
                    across the United States. We, the undersigned respectfully request the California Assembly Bill
                    AB-5 be modified to exempt professional musicians. Musicians are hardworking artists who provide
                    a valuable service to our economy and our community, most of them bringing in a modest income.
                    Many musicians are not in a union and therefore have no representation. To categorize them as
                    employees puts a heavy hardship on them. Often musicians work for several clients, both short
                    term and longer commitments throughout California and the United States. They are highly trained
                    professionals and have always worked independently. Most musicians are truly independent
                    contractors based on the following factors:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Own their own businesses as Sole Proprietors or other entity (S-Corp, C-Corp, LLC,
                                Partnership)</li>
                            <li> Possess City Business License</li>
                            <li> Set their own rates according to their knowledge and expertise</li>
                            <li> Sign Contracts for work</li>
                            <li> Provide their own Insurance</li>
                            <li> Work in their Studio or Home office</li>
                            <li> Give Music Lessons</li>
                            <li> Write Songs, Charts or Scores</li>
                            <li> Use their own tools (instruments)</li>
                            <li> May turn down work at their discretion</li>
                        </ul>
